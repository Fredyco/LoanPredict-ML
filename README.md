# LoanPredict-ML

LoanPredict-ML is a machine learning project that uses historical loan data to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. The project is designed to help lending institutions make better lending decisions and minimize the risk of loan default.

## Project Overview
The LoanPredict-ML project aims to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical loan data and identifying patterns, the project can help lending institutions make informed lending decisions and reduce the risk of loan default. The project involves data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, and the creation of a predictive model.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Streamlit

## File Descriptions
- `LoanPredict-ML.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code used for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation
- `loan_data.csv`: CSV file containing the loan data used for the project
- `Model_deployment/`: Folder containing the code for model deployment
- `Model_inference/`: Folder containing code for model inference testing

## Results
The LoanPredict-ML project was able to successfully predict the likelihood of loan default with a high degree of accuracy. The project identified the most important features that contribute to loan default and created a predictive model that can be used to assess the risk of loan default for future loan applications. These insights can be used by lending institutions to make more informed lending decisions and reduce the risk of loan default.

## Deployment
The `Model_deployment/` folder contains the code required for deploying the trained model in a production environment. The deployment code includes instructions for setting up the necessary infrastructure and integrating the model with a web application.

## Inference
The `Model_inference/` folder contains code for testing the deployed model and verifying that it is working as expected.
